## Quick Start

```bash

git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Fire it up
yarn dev
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Required - Used for sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and metadata
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://yourdomain.com

# Development - Create .env.development.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000

```

## Release Workflow

AOTC uses a fully automated release workflow:

1. Commits following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec are pushed to main
2. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Determines the version bump (major/minor/patch) based on commit messages
   - Updates the version in package.json
   - Generates/updates the CHANGELOG.md
   - Creates a new git tag
   - Creates a GitHub Release with the changelog

Breaking changes trigger a major version bump:

```bash
feat!: breaking change
# or
feat: major change

BREAKING CHANGE: description
```

New features trigger a minor version bump:

```bash
feat: add new feature
```

Bug fixes and maintenance trigger a patch version bump:

```bash
fix: bug fix
chore: routine maintenance
```

## Code Style

AOTC uses Next.js's default ESLint configuration extended with Prettier for consistent code formatting. The setup includes:

- Next.js default ESLint rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- VSCode configurations
- Format on save enabled
- ESLint auto-fix on save

### VSCode Setup

1. Install recommended extensions:

   - Prettier - Code formatter
   - ESLint

2. The project includes:
   - `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent editor settings
   - `.prettierrc` for code formatting rules
   - `.eslintrc.json` extending Next.js defaults

All formatting and linting will work automatically on save once the extensions are installed.

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Lint code
yarn lint

# Lint and fix
yarn lint:fix

# Format code
yarn format

# Check formatting
yarn format:check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The template uses Husky with lint-staged to ensure code quality before commits:

- All staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` files will be:
  - Linted with ESLint
  - Formatted with Prettier
- All staged `.md` and `.json` files will be:
  - Formatted with Prettier

These checks run automatically when you commit changes.

### PR Validation

Pull Requests to the main branch automatically trigger validation checks:

- Code formatting validation
- ESLint checks
- Test suite execution (when tests are added)

These checks must pass before the PR can be merged.
